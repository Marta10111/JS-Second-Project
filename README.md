### Game area
- The user is provided with 18 black squares that are supposed to play the role as playing cards turned upside down. The images that are hiding "behind" the cards are of 9 different images where every image has an identical twin, that the user is supposed to find. When the user hovers over a card it will react with getting a little bigger. This gives the user direct information about the possibility to click the cards.

- When the user click a card it will show an image in colour, then he is expected to click another one. When two cards are shown it will stay coloured for a while. If they are the same image, they will get a grayscale filter and stay opened. If they donâ€™t match, they will turn black again. After the cards turned back to black or got a grayscale filter, the game continues.
